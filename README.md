## Introduction

DeroGold is a digital assets project focused on preserving our life environment here on Earth.

DeroGold aspires to solve problems such as circular economy in recycling, re-use of waste materials and how we can drive positive behaviour by rewarding people with digital assets for recycling. And build habitable floating islands.

For simplicity, we say we are the digital "Nectar Card for Recycling".

However, we are much more than that. We run our own privacy digital asset that allows people and organisations to send and receive our native digital coins called DEGO.

## Installing

We offer binary images of the latest releases here: https://github.com/derogold/derogold-core/releases

If you would like to compile yourself, read on.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Build Instructions

No package manager and no submodules. Install a compiler, CMake and OpenSSL
from your own distribution, then build:

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build git libssl-dev

git clone https://github.com/derogold/derogold-core.git
cd derogold-core
cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Binaries land in `build/src`.

RocksDB is compiled from the copy in `external/`, because the version most
distributions package is older than this code needs. Nothing is downloaded
during the build, but it does make the first build noticeably longer. Pass
`-D DEROGOLD_SYSTEM_ROCKSDB=ON` to link your own copy instead, provided it is
8.1 or newer.

By default the build targets the machine it is compiled on. Pass
`-D ARCH=default` for binaries that run on other machines, at some cost in
performance.

See **[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md)** for install commands on Fedora, Arch, macOS
and MSYS2, the CMake presets, RocksDB options, and notes on MSVC.

## Docker

### Using the pre-built image

Pre-built images are published to the GitHub Container Registry on every release:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/derogold/derogold-core:latest
```

Run it straight away:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name derogoldd \
    -p 42069:42069 \
    -p 6969:6969 \
    -v derogold-data:/data \
    ghcr.io/derogold/derogold-core:latest --data-dir=/data
```

Available tags: `latest`, `v1.0.1.0`, etc.

---

### Building your own image

If you prefer to build the image yourself from source, a `Dockerfile` is included in the repository.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running

### Build the image

```bash
docker build -t derogoldd:latest .
```

### Run the container

**Standard node:**
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name derogoldd \
    -p 42069:42069 \
    -p 6969:6969 \
    -v derogold-data:/data \
    derogoldd:latest --data-dir=/data
```

**Fast sync from height 2,700,000:**
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name derogoldd \
    -p 42069:42069 \
    -p 6969:6969 \
    -v derogold-data:/data \
    derogoldd:latest --data-dir=/data --sync-from-height=2700000
```

**Pruned node:**
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name derogoldd \
    -p 42069:42069 \
    -p 6969:6969 \
    -v derogold-data:/data \
    derogoldd:latest --data-dir=/data --prune
```

### Useful commands

```bash
# View logs
docker logs -f derogoldd

# Access the daemon console
docker exec -it derogoldd DeroGoldd --help

# Stop the node
docker stop derogoldd

# Remove the container (data volume is preserved)
docker rm derogoldd
```

> **Note:** `--data-dir=/data` is what puts the blockchain on the mounted
> volume. Without it the daemon writes to `~/.DeroGold` inside the container,
> which is lost when the container is removed. With it, the data lives in the
> `derogold-data` volume and persists across restarts and removals. To start
> fresh, remove the volume with `docker volume rm derogold-data`.

## Pruned Node Mode

A pruned node retains only a recent window of raw block data, discarding historical blocks that are no longer needed for normal operation. This dramatically reduces disk usage while keeping the node fully functional for wallets and the network.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--prune` | off | Enable pruned-node mode |
| `--prune-depth=<blocks>` | 2016 | Number of recent blocks to keep (minimum 2016 ≈ 7 days) |
| `--background-prune` | on | Run the prune task periodically in the background |

With a 5-minute block target, 2016 blocks ≈ 7 days of history. Increase `--prune-depth` if you need to serve more history to wallets.

### Usage

```bash
# Pruned node keeping the last 7 days of blocks (default depth)
./DeroGoldd --prune

# Pruned node keeping the last 30 days of blocks (~8640 blocks)
./DeroGoldd --prune --prune-depth=8640

# Disable the automatic background prune task (manual control only)
./DeroGoldd --prune --background-prune=false
```

> **Note:** `--prune` must be used on a fresh data directory or combined with `--resync`. It cannot be applied to an existing fully-synced database mid-run.

### Daemon console commands

Once the node is running, use these commands from the daemon console:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `prune_status` | Show prune mode, depth, and current prune floor height |
| `compact_db [start\|status\|wait\|stop]` | Manually manage RocksDB compaction |
| `db_status` | Show database size and file statistics |

RocksDB compaction is also triggered **automatically** by a background scheduler. The scheduler runs every 60 seconds while the node is syncing, and slows to every 30 minutes once the node is near the chain tip.

## Lite Node Mode

A lite node stores full block data only from a chosen height upward, keeping just
the indexes later blocks actually read below it. It syncs, mines, relays and
validates like a full node, but cannot serve or rescan any height below its lite
height — which makes it a good fit for a node running your own wallet, and a poor
one for a public node.

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--lite` | Enable lite mode. Permanent for the database. |
| `--lite-height=<height>` | Height at and above which full block data is kept. Required. |

```bash
# A node for a wallet created at height 4,000,000
./DeroGoldd --lite --lite-height=4000000
```

Unlike `--prune`, this is decided at write time and cannot be undone without
resyncing, and it cannot be combined with `--prune` or `--daemon-mode explorer`.
See **[LITENODE.md](LITENODE.md)** for what is kept, what is lost, and how to
choose the height.

## RPC over a Local Socket

The daemon can serve its RPC on an AF_UNIX socket alongside the TCP port. What
guards a TCP port is only "who can reach 127.0.0.1:6969", which on a shared
machine is every local user; what guards a socket is the **mode on the socket
file**.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--rpc-ipc-path=<path>` | *(off)* | Also serve the RPC on this socket |
| `--rpc-ipc-mode=<octal>` | `0600` | Permissions on the socket file |
| `--rpc-ipc-group=<group>` | *(none)* | Group that owns the socket file |
| `--attach=<path>` | | Attach a console to a running daemon, instead of starting one |

POSIX only. On Windows the flags are refused with a reason: `AF_UNIX` exists
there, but the socket file carries no enforceable permissions and there is no
`SO_PEERCRED`, so the endpoint could not be restricted to its owner.

### Serving

```bash
./DeroGoldd --rpc-ipc-path /run/derogold/daemon.sock

# readable by a service group rather than only the daemon's own user
./DeroGoldd --rpc-ipc-path /run/derogold/daemon.sock \
            --rpc-ipc-mode 0660 --rpc-ipc-group derogold
```

The TCP listener is unaffected and still comes up. A socket that cannot be
bound is a warning, not a fatal error — the node keeps running without it.

The daemon refuses to remove anything at that path that is not a socket, and
refuses to take over a socket another process is still listening on, so a
mistyped `--rpc-ipc-path` cannot cost you a file.

### Connecting a wallet

Pass the socket path where a daemon address goes. An absolute path or an
`@name` abstract socket is recognised as one; nothing resolvable looks like
either, so a hostname is never mistaken for a path.

```bash
./zedwallet++ --remote-daemon /run/derogold/daemon.sock
./WalletService --daemon-address /run/derogold/daemon.sock
```

### Attaching a console

A daemon under systemd has no terminal, so its console is out of reach. `--attach`
opens one over the socket: every line runs inside that daemon through the same
command handler as the local console, and its output comes back.

```bash
./DeroGoldd --attach /run/derogold/daemon.sock
```

```
Attached to socket /run/derogold/daemon.sock
exit or quit leaves this console. stop shuts the daemon down.
> status
> exit
```

`exit` and `quit` leave the console without touching the daemon; `stop` shuts
the daemon down.

**Console commands are served on the socket only, never over TCP.** They change
log levels, ban peers, start compactions and stop the node, so the people who
may run them are exactly the people the file mode admits — the same ones who
could type at the daemon's own console. A world-writable `--rpc-ipc-mode` is
accepted but warned about loudly at startup, because the mode is the only thing
guarding it.

## Fast Sync (--sync-from-height)

The DeroGold blockchain is 350 GB+ from genesis. The `--sync-from-height` flag lets a fresh node skip the historical chain and start syncing from a recent checkpoint instead, reducing initial sync time from days to hours.

### How it works

On first launch with an empty database, the node injects a trusted anchor block at the specified height (verified against the hard-coded checkpoints) and begins downloading only blocks from that point onward. Blocks below the sync floor are trusted via the checkpoint — ring signature verification is bypassed for historical inputs that predate the floor, identically to how the standard checkpoint zone works.

> **Note:** Do not use `--sync-from-height` on mining nodes. Miners must have the full chain to correctly validate all outputs.

### Available sync floors

| Height    | Approx. date  |
|-----------|---------------|
| 2,700,000 | 2024          |

### Usage

```bash
./DeroGoldd --sync-from-height=2700000
```

The argument must match a supported height listed above. If the database already contains blocks the flag is silently ignored — use `--resync` first if you need a clean start.

### Exporting a new bootstrap state (for node operators)

If you run a fully-synced node and want to add a new floor height, run this command from the daemon console:

```
export_bootstrap_state <height>
```

The height must already exist in `CryptoNoteCheckpoints.h`. Copy the printed values into a new entry in `src/config/SyncBootstrapCheckpoints.h`, rebuild, and distribute.
